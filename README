On the first round agent_ID = 1, is the leader, and leader has 3 main tasks:
    1) scan the world for surv_loc, danger_cells, charging_cells, agents locs (from REPORT msg)
    2) Based on agent_loc, assign 2 agnets to work to together. (Either based on spawning cell at round = 1, or the two that are closer together (NOT INCLUSING LEADER) )
    3) Based on agent_partners_loc assign each partners a survivor to rescue. (A* search)

when agent_partners are going towards a survivor (which they do a local scan for adjacent cells), clear any rubble on the way & save_surv


Additional: if agent_energy < n (n is what it costs to get to the surv ), send LOW_ENERGY msg to leader, leader send you to the closest charging cell.
